# String

## [.split()](#split)

The JavaScript split method turns a string into a array. You simply need to pass one or more characters as the separator.

When you need to convert a string into an array, you first need to decide how to split that string. In other words: what character in the string indicates a new array element? For example, if you determine that any single space is a separator, then every word in the string will become a new array element.

### How to run the example code:

Copy the contents of the file: ***split.js*** and paste it into your JavaScript console.
