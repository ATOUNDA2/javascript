# Arrays

## [.push()](#push)

### The JavaScript Array push method adds one element to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

When you need to add an element to the end of an array, pass the element to the push method. Whatever you pass to the push method will be added to the end of the array. The return value of the push method is the new length of the array. For example, if you have an array named: “foo”, then you could add the word “hello” to the end of this array using this syntax:

```
foo.push(“hello”);
```

### How to run the example code:

Copy the contents of the file: ***push.js*** and paste it into your JavaScript console.

<hr />

## [.pop()](#pop)

### The JavaScript Array pop method removes the last element from the end of an array and returns the removed element.

When you need to remove the last element from the end of an array, call the pop method. . The return value of the pop method is the element that was removed. For example, if you have an array named: “foo”, then you could remove the last element from the end of the array using this syntax:

```
foo.pop();
```

### How to run the example code:

Copy the contents of the file: ***pop.js*** and paste it into your JavaScript console.

<hr />

## [.unshift()](#unshift)

### The JavaScript unshift method adds the specified value to the beginning of the array and returns the new length of the array.

### How to run the example code:

Copy the contents of the file: ***unshift.js*** and paste it into your JavaScript console.

<hr />

## [.shift()](#shift)

### The JavaScript shift method removes the first element from the array and returns that element.

### How to run the example code:

Copy the contents of the file: ***shift.js*** and paste it into your JavaScript console.

<hr />

## [.join()](#join)

### The JavaScript join method converts an array into a string.

If you pass no arguments to the JavaScript join method, then there will be no space between the characters of the string. Or, you can pass an argument that determines how to join the elements of the array. Which character(s) you provide is up to you. The most common case is to use the default, which is a comma (” , “ ), but again, this is arbitrary.

### How to run the example code:

Copy the contents of the file: ***join.js*** and paste it into your JavaScript console.

<hr />

## [.splice()](#splice)

### The JavaScript splice method removes one or more elements from any position in the array and returns the removed elements in a new array.

The **shift()** and **pop()** methods allow you to remove elements from the beginning and end of a JavaScript array. These methods are simple to use and require no arguments because there is no potential for ambiguity: the concepts **“first element”** and **“last element”** require no further explanation. But when when you want to remove one or more elements from the ***middle*** of a JavaScript array, there are details required. For example: ***where*** in the array do we want to start removing elements? Also, ***how many*** elements do we want to remove?

### How to run the example code:

Copy the contents of the file: ***splice.js*** and paste it into your JavaScript console.

<hr />

## [.concat()](#concat)

### The concat method can be used to combine to arrays. This method returns a new array and the original arrays are not changed in any way.

### How to run the example code:

Copy the contents of the file: ***concat.js*** and paste it into your JavaScript console.
